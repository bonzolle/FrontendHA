								Tricell's foundation could be traced to Thomas Travis, an 18th Century merchant during
								the Age of Exploration when he founded a trading company. With the firm entering the
								19th Century, Thomas' wealthy descendant, Henry Travis inspired by the likes of Sir
								David Livingstone funded an expedition to the African continent. This would have a
								dramatic impact on the future of the trading firm.
								<br />&nbsp;<br />
								Henry made five expeditions to the continent in all. In his thirty-four years of travels
								around West Africa, Henry developed an extensive, seventy-two volume encyclopedia on the
								region by detailing the lives and traditions of its various peoples, the local geology
								and ecology. Unfortunately, upon his return, his Natural History Conspectus was viewed
								upon by the scientific community as being largely fabricated or prone to literary
								license and as a result few copies are printed. Based on the tales that survived into
								the 21st Century, Henry's elder brother who ran the Travis firm was the cause of this
								disassociation with Henry's work, having intentionally questioned Henry's work in order
								to make sure that only the company would believe in the existence of the potential
								wealth that his younger brother described. Henry fell into a state of depression and
								died on the second year of his return, having failed to become a childhood hero like
								Livingstone.
								<br />&nbsp;<br />
								At the end of the 19th Century, the firm made its first expansion by using the
								geological information from Henry's encyclopedia to make significant inroads in Africa's
								natural resource extraction by mining for precious metals, oil and gas. It was during
								this process that the company began obtaining samples of various African animal and
								plant species, intending to sell them to the naturalists within the scientific
								community. The medicinal qualities of some of these samples are noted by the company as
								a potential source of revenue, thus creating the third 'cell' of the company which was
								the pharmaceutical sector in the mid-20th century.
								<br />&nbsp;<br />
								In the 1960s, the company went through a significant change with the three sectors by
								becoming the "cells" of the new company, "TRICELL".

								After the Umbrella Corporation was indicted in the instigation of the Raccoon City
								Destruction Incident through illegally developing biological weapons, the Federation of
								Pharmaceutical Companies (FPC) – which TRICELL's pharmaceutical division was a member of
								– was quickly disgraced, as people began to distrust many of the organizations that made
								up the federation thanks to Umbrella's own place as a senior member of the FPC. The
								organization's reputation was damaged further when it became apparent that Umbrella was
								using its fellow medical corporations as suppliers for chemicals that Umbrella used for
								its bio-weapons program. The FPC and TRICELL willingly handed over documents regarding
								their dealings to be used against Umbrella after it was agreed that they themselves
								would not be investigated further. After Umbrella lost the Raccoon Trials, the FPC began
								to restore its image by founding and funding the Bioterrorism Security Assessment
								Alliance (BSAA). TRICELL was soon a major funder of this organization.
								<br />&nbsp;<br />
								<img src="images/history2.jpg" />
								<br />&nbsp;<br />
								Despite this, TRICELL showed intimate interest in the use of bio-weapons so soon after
								the formation of the BSAA; as they had assisted in the development of the t-Abyss Virus,
								which they managed to re-acquire a sample of thanks to their moles Jessica Sherawat and
								Raymond Vester in the BSAA and the FBC, respectively, during the Queen Zenobia incident.
								<br />&nbsp;<br />
								When a fellow pharmaceutical giant – WP Corporation – collapsed after it was revealed
								that their head researcher Frederic Downing had made dealings with bioterrorists by
								selling the samples of the t-Virus in order to make hefty profits for the company once
								the t-Vaccine entered circulation, TRICELL purchased what was left of the company.
								During its investigation of the corporation's ruinous Air Dome Laboratory, its hazmat
								crews stumbled upon part of a tail believed to be from the G-Virus-infected Curtis
								Miller. The company proceeded to hack into the computer of US Senator Ron Davis as well
								as having him assassinated and completely wiping it to tie any loose ends up.

								Albert Wesker, an ambitious agent with insatiable power hunger made sure that Umbrella
								toppled after betraying it on behalf of his other employer. He broke into the
								corporation's final stronghold in the Caucasus and stole all of its data, planning to
								build his own version up to lead the world into a new era. After his ordeal in Russia in
								2003, Wesker contacted Tricell and decided to secretly work with them.
								<br />&nbsp;<br />
								Wesker agreed to provide Tricell with the viral samples of the Tyrant virus and the
								T-Veronica virus for research in exchange for capital to add to his accumulated
								resources which are salvaged from Umbrella which he initially intended to replace.
								However, he would soon find out that his destiny had more to come as he met with Oswell
								E. Spencer who was Umbrella's fugitive CEO and learned about his origins. Deciding that
								Spencer's vision was truly why the world needed to be repaired, Wesker killed him and
								decided upon a new way to remake the world that he saw as destroying itself. Thus, he
								continued working with Tricell by using all of his amassed research and assets.
								<br />&nbsp;<br />
								Wesker and Excella would meet and discuss about each other's ideals. They agreed greatly
								upon the idea of changing Earth for the sake of humanity. They forged a partnership and
								Wesker motivated Excella to take the CEO position that she so craved. To quench the
								doubt among her superiors, Excella needed to prove the usefulness of the plan that she
								and Wesker proposed. Wesker provided them with a Plaga sample and perfected it by
								creating the Type 2 and Type 3 Plagas with the assistance from Tricell's researcher,
								Ricardo Irving. The parasite's success ensured the security of Excella's position as CEO
								of Tricell Inc., Africa. The two began the creation of the most deadly virus yet, the
								Uroboros virus which was an advanced strain of the Progenitor virus.
								<br />&nbsp;<br />
								<img src="images/history3.jpg" />
								<br />&nbsp;<br />
								Having all of Umbrella's data and Spencer's personal records at his disposal, Wesker
								managed to lead Tricell to the abandoned Umbrella Africa Research Center and began the
								production of Uroboros there by setting a base up with Excella. Eventually, however,
								Tricell's doings in Africa would be discovered by the BSAA's deployed agents, Chris
								Redfield, Sheva Alomar, Jill Valentine and Josh Stone. Irving was inevitably defeated,
								Jill was rescued from her brainwashed state and Wesker ultimately betrayed Excella,
								revealing that he considered himself a god and never intended to be a "king" with
								Excella as his "queen." Nevertheless, he was defeated by Chris and Sheva and destroyed
								along with Uroboros.
